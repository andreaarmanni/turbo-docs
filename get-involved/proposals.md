# Proposals

## 1. Proposals Lifecycle

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Write Your Proposal

When writing your proposal make sure you define the type of proposal you're submitting, as well as the motivation and benefit for the community

#### üì¢  Discuss Your Proposal&#x20;

Get help & feedback from the community before you submit your proposal:

* Open a "New Post" in the Discord #Forum & post your proposal using the tag "Proposal"
* A contributor from the Community Team will engage & provide feedback to your proposal

#### üó≥  Submit Your Proposal

Once the feedback is incorporated and your proposal is ready, you can submit your proposal to the Community Team. To do so, you can mention or tag any Advisors and they will bring your proposal to the right entity:

* **Turbo Proposals** will be brought to the council. The Council will take care of executing them via Snapshots. \
  \
  _Note: All proposals handed over to the Council are by default accepted into Snapshot. However, the council reserves the rights to comment proposals before they are brought to vote._&#x20;
* **Community Proposals** will be brought to the respective Team Advisors who will take care of executing them via Discord Poll. &#x20;
