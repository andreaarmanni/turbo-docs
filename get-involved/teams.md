### Form a new Turbo Team

Forming a new Team is a great way to take your skills to the next level whilst coordinating groups of contributors to improve specific areas within Turbo. \
\
Forming a new Team is easy: write a Community Proposal[ \[CT\]](proposals.md#cp-community-proposal) explaining the WHOs & WHYs of the new Team and submit it. Before inception, each Team has to present a minimum of:

* **1x Advisor Lead** for accountability & representation&#x20;
* **3x Advisors** to execute Community Proposals
* **3x Contributors** (this includes Advisors)

Advisors are nominated every 3 months by the Turbo Community. The best way to gain votes from within the community is by starting as a contributor and earning the trust from your fellow contributors. This is a great opportunity to shape the vision & proposal execution of the team you want to become an Advisor for.&#x20;
